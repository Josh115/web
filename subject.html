			Bees are a type of flying insect known for their roles in pollination and honey production.
			Bees are found on nearly every continent other than Antarctica.
			Most bee types live in colonies or hives, but some prefer a more solitary life. A single honeybee hive can easily contain over 
			30,000 bees. 99% of bees in a hive are female worker bees, these bees are responsible for almost every task in the hive and can live up to 45 days.
			The other 1% consists of the queen bee and male drone bees
			All bees live off on nectar and pollen collected with their straw-like tongue.
			Bees are crucial to our society because of their ability to produce honey, and more importantly, the role they play in pollination.
			Bees, as the biggest pollinator on the planet, pollinate billions of plants every year, including one-third of the food crops that we grow. 
			This pollination helps grow plants like trees, berries, nuts, and fruits which can serve as food sources and habitats for various other animals
			For example, the pollination of clover and alfalfa, which are fed to cattle, help with the meat and diary industries. 
			Their honey and beeswax are used in many commercial products.

			Pollination is the process of transferring pollen grains from the male anthers of a flower to the female stigma. This allows the 
			plant to make seeds. When bees land on flowers to collect pollen, they 'collect' the pollen from the flower through the hairs on their legs
			These hairs make use of electrostatic forces in order to attract the pollen to them. This and a bee's habit of collecting from 
			similar flowers allow for efficient pollination. Pollen on the bee hairs get moved from one flower to another,
			allowing for the production of various seeds

			Until the past decade, bee populations have been declining from pesticides, habitat destruction, global warming and parasites.
			Tens of millions of deadly pesticides have been found in bee pollen.
			Bee populations have gone from 6 million hives in the 1940s to 2.4 million hives in 2008, creating a decrease in pollination levels 
			and crop production. Many pollination-limited crops like apples and cherries could be produced much faster with more bees.
