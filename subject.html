    <h2> 
      Bees are crucial to our society because of their ability to produce honey, and more importantly, the role they play in pollination. </br>
      Bees, as the biggest pollinator on the planet, pollinate billions of plants every year, including one-third of the food crops that we grow. 
	  This pollination helps grow plants like trees, berries, nuts, and fruits which can serve as food sources and habitats for various other animals </br>
	  For example, the pollination of clover and alfalfa, which are fed to cattle, help with the meat and diary industries. </br>
	  Their honey and beeswax are used in many commercial products.
