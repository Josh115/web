    <h2> The Importance of Bees </h2>
	<body>
      Bees are crucial to our society because of their ability to produce honey, and more importantly, the role they play in pollination. </br>
      Bees, as the biggest pollinator on the planet, pollinate billions of plants every year, including one-third of the food crops that we grow.  </br>
	  This pollination helps grow plants like trees, berries, nuts, and fruits which can serve as food sources and habitats for various other animals </br>
	  For example, the pollination of clover and alfalfa, which are fed to cattle, help with the meat and diary industries. </br>
	  Their honey and beeswax are used in many commercial products. </br>

    <h2> Pollination Process </h2>
	<body>
      When bees land on flowers to collect pollen, they 'collect' the pollen from the flower through the hairs on their legs</br>
	  These hairs make use of electrostatic forces in order to attract the pollen to them. This and a bee's habit of collecting from </br>
	  similar flowers allow for efficient pollination. Pollen on the bee hairs get moved from one flower to another, </br>
	  producing seeds. </br>

    <h2> The Decline of the Bees </h2>
	<body>
      Until the past decade, bee populations have been declining from pesticides, habitat destruction, global warming and parasites.</br>
	  Bee populations have gone from 6 million hives in the 1940s to 2.4 million hives in 2008, creating a decrease in pollination levels </br>
	  and crop production. Many pollination-limited crops like apples and cherries could be produced much faster with more bees. </br>
