			<h2> Introduction </h2>  Chembond is a learning ‘game’ meant to teach basic chemistry to people who do not know anything about chemistry. It is a 2D click and drag game designed to teach about a select few covalently-bonded chemical compounds.
			<h2> Instructions </h2> click and drag the orbs as they appear into the "combining-box" in the bottom-middle, once a possible compound's formula has been satisfied in the combining-box, click the check button to get a description and a few points.
			<h2> Gameplay </h2> There is not really a hard objective to the game, in other words, there is no way to ‘win’, but there is a score system to keep track of the player’s actions. The player will drag orbs indicating some basic non-metal elements to a ‘combining box’ where they could then combine the elements to determine the compound that they form together. These element orbs appear randomly. A score will be given depending on the compound created.
			<h2> How It works </h2> I've made a csv file for a list of compound names, the amount of points each one is worth, the chemical formula, and their descriptions. This data is used when a compound is created to add to the points, print out the description, and determine whether the elements in the combining-box match up to make any of the compounds in the list. The H and O orbs spawn randomly with their own dictionaries, listing the type of element they are, their position, their velocities/direction, and their size. Their position helps determine whether or not they are inside of the combining-box or touching the edges of the window, in which case, they would bounce back.
			<h2> Notes </h2> There are only 2 elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen. All possible compounds are in the list below.
