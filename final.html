			Introduction - Chembond is a learning ‘game’ meant to teach basic chemistry to people who do not know anything about chemistry. It is a 2D click and drag game designed to teach about a select few covalently-bonded chemical compounds.
			Technology - I will be using Pygame to create the graphical part of this game. I need to use it to create the drag and drop part of the game.
			Gameplay - There is not really a hard objective to the game, in other words, there is no way to ‘win’, but there is a score system to keep track of the player’s actions. The player will drag orbs indicating some basic non-metal elements to a ‘combining box’ where they could then combine the elements to determine the compound that they form together. These element orbs appear randomly. A score will be given depending on the compound created.
			*There are only 2 elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen. All possible compounds are listed below
