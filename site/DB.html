			Until the past decade, bee populations have been declining from pesticides, habitat destruction, global warming and parasites.
			Tens of millions of deadly pesticides have been found in bee pollen. 
			Bee populations have gone from 6 million hives in the 1940s to 2.4 million hives in 2008, creating a decrease in pollination levels 
			and crop production. Many pollination-limited crops like apples and cherries could be produced much faster with more bees.
			How can we help these bees? dunno, I have no idea, none.. at all.
