		Bees are a type of flying insect known for their roles in pollination and honey production.
		Bees are found on nearly every continent other than Antarctica.
		Most bee types live in colonies or hives, but some prefer a more solitary life. A single honeybee hive can easily contain over 
		30,000 bees. 99% of bees in a hive are female worker bees, these bees are responsible for almost every task in the hive and can live up to 45 days.
		The other 1% consists of the queen bee and male drone bees
		All bees live off on nectar and pollen collected with their straw-like tongue.
		Bees are crucial to our society because of their ability to produce honey, and more importantly, the role they play in pollination.
		Bees, as the biggest pollinator on the planet, pollinate billions of plants every year, including one-third of the food crops that we grow. 
		This pollination helps grow plants like trees, berries, nuts, and fruits which can serve as food sources and habitats for various other animals
		For example, the pollination of clover and alfalfa, which are fed to cattle, help with the meat and diary industries. 
		Their honey and beeswax are used in many commercial products.
