			Pollination is the process of transferring pollen grains from the male anthers of a flower to the female stigma. This allows the 
			plant to make seeds. When bees land on flowers to collect pollen, they 'collect' the pollen from the flower through the hairs on their legs
			These hairs make use of electrostatic forces in order to attract the pollen to them. This and a bee's habit of collecting from 
			similar flowers allow for efficient pollination. Pollen on the bee hairs get moved from one flower to another,
			allowing for the production of various seeds
