      Honey, typically used as a sweetener, is 70-80% sugar, with water, minerals, and protein making up the rest. There are 320 different types of honey that vary in color, oder and taste.
      Honey can also be used as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial agent. People use honey as a slave to heal burns and prevent disease. Honey is commonly used orally in cough drops to soothe the throat.
      Beeswax is used in lip balm, hand creams, salves, and moisturizers. It is also used in makeup and cosmetics; it is a good material for candle making.
